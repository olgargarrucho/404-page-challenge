- User story: I can see a page following the given design.

Once completed, I give my personal touches by adding transition, using my own images and changing colors.

I have practiced the position of elements with Flexbox, CSS transition and styles and this README.md.

I loved this proyect because it has served me for establish knowledge about HTML and CSS.
